## What is Component?

Component is a client-side HTML, CSS, and/or JS packaging tool.

See https://github.com/component/component for a description and http://component.io
for an index of existing Component packages.

## What this code is based on

This started off based exactly off of the `component create` project template, with
these options:

    $ component create boilerplate
    repo (username/project): audreyr/boilerplate
    description: Boilerplate for creating a basic Component package.
    does this component have js? y
    does this component have css? y
    does this component have html? y

          create : boilerplate
          create : boilerplate/index.js
          create : boilerplate/template.html
          create : boilerplate/boilerplate.css
          create : boilerplate/Makefile
          create : boilerplate/Readme.md
          create : boilerplate/History.md
          create : boilerplate/.gitignore
          create : boilerplate/component.json
      
This is now evolving past that to meet @audreyr's personal needs, though.
