## What is Component?

Component is a client-side HTML, CSS, and/or JS packaging tool.

See https://github.com/component/component for a description and http://component.io
for an index of existing Component packages.

## What this code is based on

This is currently based exactly off of the `component create` project template, with
these options:

    $ component create ribbon
    repo (username/project): audreyr/ribbon 
    description: Ribbon component that sticks out from the side of a website.
    does this component have js? y
    does this component have css? y
    does this component have html? y

          create : ribbon
          create : ribbon/index.js
          create : ribbon/template.html
          create : ribbon/ribbon.css
          create : ribbon/Makefile
          create : ribbon/Readme.md
          create : ribbon/History.md
          create : ribbon/.gitignore
          create : ribbon/component.json
      
This may evolve a bit, though.
